# Student-Management-System
The Student Management System is a web-based application designed to help administrators, teachers, and other staff efficiently manage student data. The system leverages a combination of modern technologies to provide a seamless user experience, robust backend logic, and secure database management.

Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript): The user interface is built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic interaction. The system features responsive pages that work across different devices and ensure easy navigation. JavaScript is used to handle client-side validation, form submissions, and dynamic content rendering.

Backend (Java, Spring MVC, Hibernate ORM): The backend of the system is developed using Java and Spring MVC, enabling a modular, maintainable, and scalable architecture. Spring MVC handles routing and request mapping, while Hibernate ORM simplifies database interaction by mapping Java objects to relational database tables. This allows for efficient data operations like adding, updating, and deleting student records.

Database (MySQL): The system uses MySQL as the database management system to store student information. MySQL provides a reliable and efficient way to handle large amounts of student data, such as student names, roll numbers, courses, grades, and more. The integration of Hibernate ORM helps optimize database queries and maintains the integrity of the data.

Key Features:

Admin login with role-based access control.
CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing student records.
Secure data storage and retrieval with MySQL and Hibernate ORM.
Interactive and responsive UI with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The Student Management System is designed to improve the management of student records and streamline administrative tasks. With its clean user interface, powerful backend, and robust database integration, the system is a reliable solution for any educational institution seeking to automate student data management.
